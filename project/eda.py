# EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches
# For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.
#
# In the next few problems, you will look at the beak depth of G. scandens on Daphne Major in 1975 and in 2012. To start with, let's plot all of the beak depth measurements in 1975 and 2012 in a bee swarm plot.
#
# The data are stored in a pandas DataFrame called df with columns 'year' and 'beak_depth'. The units of beak depth are millimeters (mm).

# Create bee swarm plot
_ = sns.swarmplot(x='year', y='beak_depth', data=df)

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('year')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Compute ECDFs
x_1975, y_1975 = ecdf(bd_1975)
x_2012, y_2012 = ecdf(bd_2012)

# Plot the ECDFs
_ = plt.plot(x_1975, y_1975, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_2012, y_2012, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set margins
plt.margins(0.02)

# Add axis labels and legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='lower right')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Parameter estimates of beak depths
# Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.
#
# Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.

# Compute the difference of the sample means: mean_diff
mean_diff =  np.mean(bd_2012) - np.mean(bd_1975)

# Get bootstrap replicates of means
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975, np.mean, size=10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute samples of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_diff_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])

# Print the results
print('difference of means =', mean_diff, 'mm')
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'mm')


# Hypothesis test: Are beaks deeper in 2012?
# Your plot of the ECDF and determination of the confidence interval make it pretty clear that the beaks of G. scandens on Daphne Major have gotten deeper. But is it possible that this effect is just due to random chance? In other words, what is the probability that we would get the observed difference in mean beak depth if the means were the same?
#
# Be careful! The hypothesis we are testing is not that the beak depths come from the same distribution. For that we could use a permutation test. The hypothesis is that the means are equal. To perform this hypothesis test, we need to shift the two data sets so that they have the same mean and then use bootstrap sampling to compute the difference of means.

# Compute mean of combined data set: combined_mean
combined_mean = np.mean(np.concatenate((bd_1975, bd_2012)))

# Shift the samples
bd_1975_shifted = bd_1975 - np.mean(bd_1975) + combined_mean
bd_2012_shifted = bd_2012 - np.mean(bd_2012) + combined_mean

# Get bootstrap replicates of shifted data sets
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975_shifted, np.mean, size=10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012_shifted, np.mean, size=10000)

# Compute replicates of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute the p-value
p = np.sum(bs_diff_replicates >= mean_diff) / len(bs_diff_replicates)

# Print p-value
print('p =', p)


# Make scatter plot of 1975 data
_ = plt.plot(bl_1975, bd_1975, marker='.',
             linestyle='none', alpha=0.5, color='blue')

# Make scatter plot of 2012 data
_ = plt.plot(bl_2012, bd_2012, marker='.',
             linestyle='none', alpha=0.5, color='red')

# Label axes and make legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak length (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='upper left')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
