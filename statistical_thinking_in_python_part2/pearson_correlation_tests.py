# Hypothesis test on Pearson correlation
# The observed correlation between female illiteracy and fertility may just be by chance; the fertility of a given country may actually be totally independent of its illiteracy.
# You will test this hypothesis.
# To do so, permute the illiteracy values but leave the fertility values fixed.
# This simulates the hypothesis that they are totally independent of each other.
# For each permutation, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and assess how many of your permutation replicates have a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than the observed one.
#
# Compute observed correlation: r_obs
r_obs = pearson_r(illiteracy, fertility)

# Initialize permutation replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):
    # Permute illiteracy measurments: illiteracy_permuted
    illiteracy_permuted = np.random.permutation(illiteracy)

    # Compute Pearson correlation
    perm_replicates[i] = pearson_r(illiteracy_permuted, fertility)

# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= r_obs) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-val =', p)


# Do neonicotinoid insecticides have unintended consequences?
# As a final exercise in hypothesis testing before we put everything together in our case study in the next chapter, you will investigate the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bee reproduction. These insecticides are very widely used in the United States to combat aphids and other pests that damage plants.
#
# In a recent study, Straub, et al. (Proc. Roy. Soc. B, 2016) investigated the effects of neonicotinoids on the sperm of pollinating bees. In this and the next exercise, you will study how the pesticide treatment affected the count of live sperm per half milliliter of semen.
#
# First, we will do EDA, as usual. Plot ECDFs of the alive sperm count for untreated bees (stored in the Numpy array control) and bees treated with pesticide (stored in the Numpy array treated).

# Compute the difference in mean sperm count: diff_means
diff_means = diff_of_means(control, treated)

# Compute mean of pooled data: mean_count
mean_count = np.mean(np.concatenate((control, treated)))

# Generate shifted data sets
control_shifted = control - np.mean(control) + mean_count
treated_shifted = treated - np.mean(treated) + mean_count

# Generate bootstrap replicates
bs_reps_control = draw_bs_reps(control_shifted,
                       np.mean, size=10000)
bs_reps_treated = draw_bs_reps(treated_shifted,
                       np.mean, size=10000)

# Get replicates of difference of means: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = bs_reps_control - bs_reps_treated

# Compute and print p-value: p
p = np.sum(bs_replicates >= np.mean(control) - np.mean(treated)) \
            / len(bs_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)
